Introduction
===

Welcome to the AWS Docs SDK Examples. Here, you'll find examples of how to use the various SDKs that
AWS provides for interacting with its services.

These examples are used, live, in the `AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com>`_. For more
information on getting started with the SDKs for AWS, see `Tools to Build on AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/>`_.



Prequisites for all SDKs 
------------------------

All of the examples in this documentation presume that you have an AWS account. AWS accounts are
available free of charge, and all AWS accounts are granted certain free services. For more information,
see `the AWS Free Tier<https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`_. 

Configuring the SDKs
--------------------

AWS SDKs must be configured with the *AWS Access Key ID*, *AWS Secret Key*, and in some cases *Session ID*.

The simplest way to do so is using the AWS CLI. If you have already configured it, most SDKs will use the
configuration created by the AWS CLI. If you have not configured the AWS CLI, you can use::

   aws configure

to configure the AWS CLI. This will create or update the file ``$HOME/.aws/credentials``, which is used
by the SDKs where possible or practicable. 

The AWS SDKs will, as a general rule, look in the following places for this information, in order
of ascending priority:

* Within ``$HOME/.aws/credentials``, in the default profile
* Within ``$HOME/.aws/credentials``, in the profile defined by the ``AWS_PROFILE`` environment variable
* The ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``, ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``, and (if defined,) ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` environment variables.
* An SDK-specific location such as the Java SDK system property ``aws.accessKeyId`` and ``aws.secretKey``.
* Credentials specified directly to the SDK, such as ``AWSBasicCredentials`` in the Java V2 SDK.

If you are unsure, see the documentation for the specific SDK you are using.

Costs incurred by, side effects of these examples
-------------------------------------------------

Examples in this repository are not restricted to the AWS Free Tier. Many of them involve services which are
charged on a per-use basis such as AWS SES, while others may create resources that have long-term costs such
as Amazon S3 Glacier storage. 

Some examples modify or destroy resources, such as AWS IAM users, Amazon S3 bucket contents or previous versions,
and more. It is your responsibility to be aware of the resources these examples create or destroy, the costs
that may be incurred upon your account as a result, as well as have backups of important data. 


SDKs and support status
=======================

SDKs and their respective examples fall into three categories: 

* Currently maintained
* In preview 
* Deprecated

SDKs that are in preview are not guaranteed to be stable or consistent. The examples for these SDKs
are not guaranteed to be fully up to date. These example should not be used in any form of "production"
environment, and may not be fully tested.

Deprecated examples are not guaranteed to be current or follow current best practices, and are kept here
primarily for historical posterity and reference only.

Each SDK is referenced by its top-level folder: ``cpp`` for the C++ SDK for AWS, ``python`` for boto3, and
so on. Preview SDK paths are subject to change.

Inside each language-specific directory, we include a **README** file that explains how to
build and run the examples in the directory.

The example code in the language-specific directories is organized by
the AWS service command in the `AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) Command Reference <https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/index.html>`_ (**s3** for `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ examples, and so
on).



Examples under currently maintained SDKs
----------------------------------------

The code examples are organized by AWS SDK or AWS programming tool. For example, among the top-level folders:

* **cpp** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for C++ (version 1)
* **dotnetv3** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for .NET (version 3.5 and later)
* **gov2** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Go (version 2)
* **javav2** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Java (version 2)
* **javascriptv3** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for JavaScript (version 3)
* **php** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for PHP (version 3)
* **python** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
* **ruby** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Ruby (version 3)


Examples under SDKs currently in preview 
----------------------------------------

* **.kotlin_alpha** for the alpha version of the AWS SDK for Kotlin.
* **rust_dev_preview** for the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Examples under SDKs that have been deprecated
---------------------------------------------

Code examples for older AWS SDK versions are archived in this repository but no longer maintained. These include:

* **dotnet** for versions of the AWS SDK for .NET prior to version 3.5
* **go** for AWS SDK for Go version 1
* **java** for AWS SDK for Java version 1
* **javascript** for AWS SDK for JavaScript version 2

As AWS SDK major version numbers increment, this repository will begin to more consistently reflect their version numbers among these folders to make these distinctions clearer. For example, if and when the AWS SDK for Ruby moves to a version 4, a new **rubyv4** folder will be added. Then when AWS officially announces that AWS SDK for Ruby version 3 has been deprecated, the **ruby** folder will be deleted.

Other examples
--------------

Other top-level folders include:

* **aws-cli** for script examples for use with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
* **cloudformation** for example templates for use with AWS CloudFormation.
* **iam_policies** for example policy documents for use with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* **lambda_functions** for example function code for use with AWS Lambda.
* **typescript** for TypeScript-based code examples for use with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), and other AWS services. (For TypeScript-based code examples for use with the AWS SDK for JavaScript, see the **javascriptv3** folder.)



Contributing
============

Proposing new code examples
---------------------------

To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider working on, `create a 
request <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=&labels=code+sample+request&template=request-new-code-example.md&title=%5BNEW+EXAMPLE+REQUEST%5D+%3C%3CProvide+a+title+for+this+proposal%3E%3E>`_.

Note that the AWS documentation team prefers to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use 
cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls.

Submitting code examples
------------------------

If you plan to contribute examples for use in the documentation (the purpose of this repository),
read this section carefully so that we can work together effectively. 
For process instructions and additional guidance, see the `Guidelines for contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_. 


Assorted and Sundry
===================

The ``scripts/`` folder
-----------------------

The **scripts** folder contains scripts that the AWS documentation team uses internally to build the code examples into various AWS documentation sets.


Default branch name change
--------------------------

We have changed the default branch for this repo from **master** to **main**.

If the parent branch of your fork or branch is **master**,
the following instructions tell you how to change the parent branch to **main**.

To show the parent branch,
where **BRANCH** is the name of your branch:

1. Navigate to the root of your branch or fork.
2. Make sure your branch is the current branch (**git checkout BRANCH**).
3. Run **git branch --contains**.

Changing a branch parent branch from master to main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change the parent branch for your branch to **main**,
navigate to the root of your branch and enter the following commands,
where *BRANCH* is the name of your branch:

.. code-block:: sh
		
   git branch -m master main
   git fetch origin
   git branch -u origin/main main
   git remote set-head origin -a
   git remote update --prune

Changing a fork's default branch from master to main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GitHub will notify you when a parent branch has changed.
To change your fork's default branch to **main**:

1. Navigate to main web page of your fork.
2. You should see a "The default branch on the parent repository has been renamed" message.
3. Select the **branch settings** link.
4. Change **master** to **main**.



Questions or Issues?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have any questions, or run across any issue retargeting your branch or fork,
open an issue and give us as much detail as possible.
