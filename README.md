# AWS SDK Code Examples
This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the AWSK SDK's to interact with AWS services.

Many examples are injected into the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com).

## Get started
To invoke this example code, you must have an AWS account. For more information about creating an account, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). 

You must also have AWS credentials configured, specifically a *AWS Access Key ID* and *AWS Secret Key*. In some cases, you need a *Session ID*. We recommend you accomplish this using the AWS CLI. To learn more, see [CLI Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)

## ⚠️ Important
These code examples interact with services that may incur charges to your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).

Additionally, example code may theoretically modify or delete existing AWS resources. As a matter of due diligence:
 * Be aware of the resources that these examples create or delete.
 * Be aware of the costs that might be charged to your account as a result.
 * Back up your important data.

## SDK Support
This SDK example code is supported to varying degrees:

| status     | description               |
|------------|---------------------------|
| GA         | Bug-free. Recommended.    |
| deprecated | Unsupported. User beware. |
| preview    | Encouraged. User beware.  |


## How this repository is organized
Code examples for each language's SDK can be found within the following sub-directories:

| SDK        | folder                                | SDK version | SDK status  |
|------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

At the top level of each directory, a README explains how to build and run that set of examples.

Within each directory, an `example_code/` folder contains examples organized by AWS service. For example `ruby/example_code/ec2` contains example code using the SDK for Ruby 

## Examples for currently maintained SDKs
The code examples are organized by AWS SDK or AWS programming tool. The following list shows some of the top-level folders:

* **cpp** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for C++ (version 1)
* **dotnetv3** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for .NET (version 3.5 and later)
* **gov2** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Go (version 2)
* **javav2** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Java (version 2)
* **javascriptv3** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for JavaScript (version 3)
* **php** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for PHP (version 3)
* **python** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
* **ruby** for the latest version of the AWS SDK for Ruby (version 3)


## Examples for SDKs currently in preview 
* **.kotlin_alpha** for the alpha version of the AWS SDK for Kotlin
* **swift** for the preview release of the AWS SDK for Swift
* **rust_dev_preview** for the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust

## Examples for SDKs that have been deprecated

Code examples for previous AWS SDK versions are archived in this repository but are no longer maintained. These include the following:

* **dotnet** for versions of the AWS SDK for .NET prior to version 3.5
* **go** for AWS SDK for Go version 1
* **java** for AWS SDK for Java version 1
* **javascript** for AWS SDK for JavaScript version 2

As AWS SDK major version numbers increment, this repository will more consistently reflect the version numbers in these folders.
For example, imagine that the AWS SDK for Ruby moves to a version 4.
A new rubyv4 folder is added. In this scenario, if AWS officially announces that version 3 of the AWS SDK for Ruby is no longer supported,
then the previous ruby folder is deleted.

## Other examples
Other top-level folders include the following:

| folder                                | service                                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [aws-cli/](aws-cli)                   | AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)     |
| [cloudformation/](cloudformation)     | AWS CloudFormation                       |
| [iam_policies/](iam_policies)         | AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) |
| [lambda_functions/](lambda_functions) | AWS Lambda                               |
| [typescript/](typescript)             | AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)      |

# Contributing
If you plan to contribute examples for use in the documentation, see the `Guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Note that the AWS documentation team prefers to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use 
cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls.

* To propose a new code example for our consideration, [create a request](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=&labels=code+sample+request&template=request-new-code-example.md&title=%5BNEW+EXAMPLE+REQUEST%5D+%3C%3CProvide+a+title+for+this+proposal%3E%3E).
* To submit a code example you have written, [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/compare) and follow the steps in the PR template.

## Additional Information

The `scripts/` folder

The **scripts** folder contains scripts that the AWS documentation team uses internally to build the code examples into various AWS documentation sets.


## Default branch name change

We have changed the default branch for this repo from **master** to **main**.

If the parent branch of your fork or branch is **master**,
the following instructions tell you how to change the parent branch to **main**.

To show the parent branch,
where **BRANCH** is the name of your branch:

1. Navigate to the root of your branch or fork.
2. Make sure your branch is the current branch (**git checkout BRANCH**).
3. Run **git branch --contains**.

### Changing a branch parent branch from master to main
To change the parent branch for your branch to **main**,
navigate to the root of your branch and enter the following commands,
where *BRANCH* is the name of your branch:

```		
   git branch -m master main
   git fetch origin
   git branch -u origin/main main
   git remote set-head origin -a
   git remote update --prune
```

### Changing a fork's default branch from master to main
GitHub will notify you when a parent branch has changed.
To change your fork's default branch to **main**:

1. Navigate to main web page of your fork.
2. You should see a "The default branch on the parent repository has been renamed" message.
3. Select the **branch settings** link.
4. Change **master** to **main**.

# Questions or issues?
If you have any questions, or if you experience an issue when retargeting your branch or fork,
create a new GitHub issue and include as much detail as possible.
