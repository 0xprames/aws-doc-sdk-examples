# AWS SDK Code Examples
This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the AWSK SDK's to interact with AWS services.

Many examples are injected into the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com).

## Get started
To invoke this example code, you must have an AWS account. For more information about creating an account, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). 

You must also have AWS credentials configured. For steps on using the CLI to configure credentials, see [CLI Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)

## ⚠️ Usage Disclaimer
These code examples interact with services that may incur charges to your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).

Additionally, example code may theoretically modify or delete existing AWS resources. As a matter of due diligence:
 * Be aware of the resources that these examples create or delete.
 * Be aware of the costs that might be charged to your account as a result.
 * Back up your important data.


## How this repository is organized

At the top level of each directory, a README explains how to build and run that set of examples.

Within each directory, an `example_code/` folder contains examples organized by AWS service. For example `ruby/example_code/ec2` contains example code using the SDK for Ruby.

## Other examples
Additionally, this repository contains sample code for non-SDK AWS tooling:
