# AWS SDK for Rust code examples for Amazon S3

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to perform several Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) operations using the developer preview version of the AWS SDK for Rust.

Use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

## Code examples

- [Create basic client](src/bin/client.rs) (ListBuckets)
- [Copies an object from one bucket to another](src/bin/copy-object.rs) (CopyObject)
- [Create a bucket](src/bin/create-bucket.rs) (CreateBucket)
- [Delete an object from a bucket](src/bin/delete-object.rs) (DeleteObject)
- [Deletes one or more objects from a bucket](src/bin/delete-objects.rs) (DeleteObjects)
- [Lists your buckets](src/bin/list-buckets.rs) (ListBuckets)
- [Lists the objects in a bucket](src/bin/list-objects.rs) (ListObjectsV2)
- [Lists the versions of the objects in a bucket](src/bin/list-object-versions.rs) (ListObjectVersions)
- [Lists your buckets and uploads a file to a bucket](src/bin/s3-helloworld.rs) (ListBuckets, PutObject)
- [Lists your buckets at a specified endpoint](src/bin/s3-object-lambda.rs) (ListBuckets)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege, 
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code examples

### Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and AWS Region as described in [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust).

### client

This example creates a basic client and lists your Amazon S3 buckets.

`cargo run --bin client -- [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### copy-object

This example copies an object from one Amazon S3 bucket to another.

`cargo run --bin copy-object -- -s SOURCE-BUCKET -d DESTINATION-BUCKET -k KEY [-n NEW-NAME] [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _SOURCE-BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket containing the object to copy.
- _DESTINATION-BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket where the object is copied to.
- _KEY_ is the name of the object to copy.
- _NEW-NAME_ is the optioal name of the object in the destination bucket.
  If not supplied, defaults to the value of _KEY_.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### create-bucket

This example creates an Amazon S3 bucket.

`cargo run --bin create-bucket -- -b BUCKET [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket to create.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### delete-object

This example deletes an object from an Amazon S3 bucket.

`cargo run --bin delete-object -- -b BUCKET -k KEY [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket.
- _KEY_ is the name of the object.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### delete-objects

This example deletes one or more objects from an Amazon S3 bucket.

`cargo run --bin delete-objects -- -b BUCKET -o OBJECTS [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket.
- _OBJECTS_ are the names of the objects to delete, separated by spaces.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### list-buckets

This example lists your Amazon S3 buckets.

`cargo run --bin list-buckets -- [-s] [-r REGION] [-v]`

- __-s__ display only buckets in the Region.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### list-objects

This example lists the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

`cargo run --bin list-objects -- -b BUCKET [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
  If not supplied, uses the value of the __AWS_REGION__ environment variable.
  If the environment variable is not set, defaults to __us-west-2__.
- __-v__ displays additional information.

### list-object-versions

This example lists the versions of the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

`cargo run --bin list-objects -- -b BUCKET [-r REGION] [-v]`

- _BUCKET_ is the name of the bucket.
- _REGION_ is the Region in which the client is created.
