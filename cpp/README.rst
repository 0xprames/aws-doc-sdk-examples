AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples
#############################

A collection of code examples for the AWS SDK for C++. The examples are grouped
according to the AWS service they demonstrate.

Prerequisites
=============

Before using the Code Examples, first complete the installation and setup steps of `Getting Started  
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`_ in the AWS SDK for C++
Developer Guide.

The Getting Started section covers how to obtain and build the SDK, and how to build your own
 code utilizing the SDK with a sample “Hello World”-style application.  A similar procedure is 
 applicable to utilizing the code examples in this repository.
 
Additional information geared specifically to understanding the example applications is at
 `AWS SDK for C++ Code Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/programming-services.html>`_.
 
To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing, create a 
new request. The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use 
cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls. For instructions, see
 the “Proposing new code examples” section in the 
 `Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
