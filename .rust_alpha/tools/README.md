# Tools for Rust

This directory contains some files that I use for my Rust development.

## VSCode Snippets

There are two Visual Studio Code snippet files in this directory:

- **rust.json** contains VSCode snippets, such as **region**,
  which inserts the Rust code to create a region.

- **toml.json** contains one VSCode snippet, **Cargo.toml**,
  which inserts the typical package declarations.

To get these in VSCode, copy them to:

- Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets
- Mac $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets
- Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets
