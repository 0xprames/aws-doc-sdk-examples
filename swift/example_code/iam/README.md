# Amazon IAM code examples for the SDK for Swift
## Overview
This folder contains code examples demonstrating how to use the AWS SDK for
Swift to use the Amazon Identity and Access Management (`IAM`). This README
discusses how to run these examples.

Amazon Identity and Access Management (`Amazon IAM`) lets you specify who and
what can access services and resources on your AWS account, centrally manage
fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.
* [Attach an IAM policy to a
  role](./AttachRolePolicy/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift).
  (`AttachRolePolicy`)
* [Create a new IAM user](./CreateUser/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`CreateUser`)
* [Create an IAM role](./CreateRole/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`CreateRole`)
* [Create an IAM role linked to a specific service](./CreateServiceLinkedRole/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`CreateServiceLinkedRole`)
* [Get information about an IAM role](./GetRole/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`GetRole`)
* [Get information about an IAM policy](./GetPolicy/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`GetPolicy`)
* [List the managed policies attached to a role](./ListAttachedRolePolicies/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift). (`ListAttachedRolePolicies`)
* [List all groups on an AWS account](./ListGroups/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`ListGroups`)
* [List all AWS policies](./ListPolicies/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`ListPolicies`)
* [List the policies embedded in a role](./ListRolePolicies/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift). This does _not_ include managed policies attached to the role. (`ListRolePolicies`)
* [List all users on an AWS account](./ListUsers/Sources/ServiceHandler/ServiceHandler.swift) (`ListUsers`)


<!-- ### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.
 -->

<!-- ### Cross-service examples
Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

## Running the examples
To build any of these examples from a terminal window, navigate into its directory then use the command:

```
$ swift build
```

To build one of these examples in Xcode, navigate to the example's directory
(such as the `ListUsers` directory, to build that example), then type `xed.`
to open the example directory in Xcode. You can then use standard Xcode build
and run commands.

### Prerequisites
See the [Prerequisites](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift#Prerequisites) section in the README for the AWS SDK for Swift examples repository.

## Tests
⚠️ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

To run the tests for an example, use the command `swift test` in the example's directory.
