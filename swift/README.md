# AWS SDK for Swift code examples
## Overview
The code examples in this topic show you how to use the AWS SDK for Swift with AWS.

The AWS SDK for Swift provides a Swift API for AWS infrastructure services. Using the SDK, you can build applications on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

## Types of code examples
* **Single-service actions** - Code examples that show you how to call individual service functions.

* **Single-service scenarios** - Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* **Cross-service examples** - Sample applications that work across multiple AWS services.

Single-service actions and scenarios are organized by AWS service in the
[example_code](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift/example_code/)
directory. A README in each folder lists and describes how to run the examples.

Cross-service examples are located in the [cross_service](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/swift/cross_service/)
directory. A README in each folder describes how to run the example.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
*  We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Prerequisites
You must have an AWS account, and have configured your default credentials and
AWS Region as described in the [Getting started
section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift/latest/developer-guide/getting-started.html)
of the _AWS SDK for Swift Developer Guide_.

## Tests
**Note**: Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

To run the tests for an example, use the command `swift test` in the example's directory.
